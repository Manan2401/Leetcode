# 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c


## Approach
Consider the i'th bit of c. There are two cases:

 - The i'th bit is equal to 0
This means the i'th bit in a and b must both be 0. We need to flip any of the 1-bits to 0.

 - The i'th bit is equal to 1
This means either the i'th bit in a or the i'th bit in b must be 1. If neither are 1, we must flip at least one bit.
