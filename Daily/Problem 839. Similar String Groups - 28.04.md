# 839. Similar String Groups

## Intuition:
The problem can be reduced to finding connected components in an undirected graph where each node in the graph represents a string and an edge between two nodes represents that the corresponding strings are similar. If two strings are similar, we can merge their corresponding sets using the union-find data structure. At the end, the number of disjoint sets in the union-find data structure represents the number of connected components in the graph, which gives us the number of groups of similar strings.

To check if two strings are similar, we can simply compare them character by character and count the number of differences. If the number of differences is greater than 2, then we can say that the two strings are not similar. Otherwise, we can say that they are similar and can be merged into the same set.
