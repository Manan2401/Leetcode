# 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List
## Approach:
 - To find the maximum twin sum, we need to pair up the elements in the linked list in a way that maximizes the sum of each pair.
 - We can achieve this by rearranging the elements in the linked list.
 - First, we need to reverse the first half of the linked list. This can be done using the two-pointer technique, where one pointer moves at a normal pace (slow pointer), and the other pointer moves twice as fast (fast pointer).
 - While reversing the first half, we also keep track of the previous pointer to the slow pointer, as we will need it later to calculate the sum.
 - After reversing the first half, we adjust the pointers if the length of the linked list is odd.
 - Finally, we iterate through the reversed first half and the second half, calculating the sum of each pair and keeping track of the maximum sum encountered.
