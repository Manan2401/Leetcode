# 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings

## Approach:
 - The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can define dp[i] as the total number of valid strings of length i. A valid string is one that contains no more than k consecutive identical characters, where k is the minimum of the number of zeros and the number of ones.

 - We can compute dp[i] by considering all the valid strings of length i-1. To count the number of valid strings of length i that end with a zero, we can count the number of valid strings of length i-1 that end with a one, and vice versa. We can then add these two values to get dp[i].

 - Finally, we can compute the answer as the sum of dp[i] for i = low to high.
